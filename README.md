# Overview

Developed by Bar Amir, Matan Wilchek, Alon Kagan and Roey Ravits as our semestrial project in the [Google Technologies for Cloud and Web Development Workshop](https://sites.google.com/site/cloudweb18b/) at Tel Aviv University.

# Installation

The Web app is running on Chrome, Safari, Firefox. <br>
In order to edit code, you will need to install NodeJS.

# Usage Instructions

## Login page

In case of forgetting your password, you can reset it using 'forgot password'.<br>
A link to reset your password will be sent to your mail.

## Control panel page - Administrator

You can view informative data about this week volunteers and tasks.

## Volunteers page - Administrator

You can view the list of active and inactive users (volunteers).<br>
You can add a new user menually or 'from file'.<br>
If you choose 'from file', you will need to follow the example file ("/users.xlsx"), and fill the same columns and fields.<br>
For every active user you can take different actions under 'options'. You can edit his personal info, change his password, change his permissions to administrator, or disable his account.<br>
For every inactive user you can bring him back to be active.<br>
You can use the search field to filter the list, under chosen column. <br>
You can export the list of users as an excel file using 'export users report'.

## Tasks Page - Administrator

You can view the list of tasks for this week, past tasks, or future tasks.<br>
You can add a new task menually or 'from file'.<br>
If you choose 'from file', you will need to follow the example file ("/tasks.xlsx"), and fill the same columns and fields.<br>
For every task you can take different actions under 'options'. You can edit its info or delete it.<br>
For every task there is an icon (on the right side of the row), which indicates its status: 'assigned', 'assigned but hasn't been done yet', 'done but its report hasn't been filled yet', 'done and report filled'. <br>
You can filter tasks by their status, on the bottom left buttons. <br>
You can export the list of tasks as an excel file using 'export tasks report'. In that file you can view also the reports filled by users (at the same row of the relevant task).

## Personal information page - Administrator and User
